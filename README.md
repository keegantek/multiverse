# Multiverse
A simple authentication system for scalable digital projects

## Introduction
Multiverse is an authentication system for PHP web projects. It can serve as a foundational building block for web tools that require pages to be protected behind a wall.

## Current Pages
- **index.php** the generic landing page
- **login.php** the sign in page
- **register.php** the sign up page

All controlled processing takes place in the /processing directory. Database connections are instances of the DB Model.
